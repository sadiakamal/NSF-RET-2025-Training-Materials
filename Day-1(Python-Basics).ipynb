Modules are like toolboxes‚Äîcollections of functions and variables that you can import and use in your program. The math module provides mathematical constants and functions, such as pi and sqrt(). The datetime module allows you to work with dates and times, and by importing datetime and date directly, you can quickly get the current time and date. The random module is used to generate random numbers, and in this case, it's imported with an alias (rd) to make function calls shorter.
